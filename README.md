# Brem Coding Challenge - Login and Sign-Up Form

## Overview

Welcome to the Brem Coding Challenge - Login and Sign-Up Form edition! This challenge focuses on building a simple login and sign-up form. My objective is to implement the form functionalities and log the entered data to the console. 

## Challenge Description

The goal of this coding challenge is to create a web-based login and sign in and log to thr console.


1. **Login Form:**
   - Fields: Username and Password
   - Validation: Ensure that both fields are filled before allowing submission.

2. **Sign-Up Form:**
   - Fields: Username, Email, Password, Confirm Password
   - Validation: Ensure all fields are filled, the email is in a valid format, and the passwords match.

3. **Logging Data:**
   - Console log the entered data from both the login and sign-up forms.

Make sure to handle edge cases gracefully and provide clear feedback to users.
